## 📌 Project Overview

Employee attrition is one of the most expensive HR challenges an organization faces. Replacing a single employee can cost **50–200% of their annual salary** — accounting for recruitment, onboarding, lost productivity, and team disruption.

This project delivers a **full-stack people analytics solution** using the IBM HR Employee Attrition dataset. It answers two core questions:

> **"What drives employees to leave — and which employees are most likely to leave next?"**

The notebook is structured around the **PACE framework** (Plan · Analyze · Construct · Execute) and produces both a **predictive ML model** and **actionable business recommendations** that HR leadership can implement immediately.

## 📊 Dataset

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Source** | [IBM HR Analytics — Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rishikeshkonapure/hr-analytics-prediction) |
| **Records** | 1,470 employees |

| **Missing Values** | Zero |
| **Duplicates** | Zero |

## 🔑 Key Findings

| # | Finding | Attrition Impact |
|---|---------|-----------------|
| 1 | **Overtime employees** leave at 30.5% vs 10.4% for non-OT | **2.9× multiplier** |
| 2 | **Leavers earn 38% less** — median $3,202 vs $5,204 for stayers | Income is a primary driver |
| 3 | **Sales Representatives** have 39.8% attrition — highest of any role | Nearly 1 in 2 leaves |
| 4 | **Entry-level (Job Level 1)** employees leave at 26.3% | Career growth is lacking |
| 5 | **Zero stock options** → 24.4% attrition vs 9.4% with Level 1 equity | **2.6× multiplier** |
| 6 | **Single employees** leave at 25.5% vs 12.5% married | Life-stage mobility |
| 7 | **Frequent travelers** leave at 24.9% vs 8.0% non-travelers | Travel fatigue is real |
| 8 | **Year 0–1** has 34–36% attrition — the critical onboarding window | First year is make-or-break |
| 9 | **Low job satisfaction (score 1)** → 22.8% vs 11.3% at score 4 | Satisfaction is protective |
| 10 | **Poor work-life balance (score 1)** → 31.3% attrition | Compounding burnout risk |

## 🔧 Feature Engineering

Seven domain-informed features were created before modeling:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `overtime_flag` | Binary indicator — employee works overtime |
| `satisfaction_index` | Average of job, environment & relationship satisfaction scores |
| `income_per_exp` | Monthly income ÷ (total working years + 1) — compensation efficiency |
| `tenure_ratio` | Years at company ÷ (total working years + 1) — company loyalty fraction |
| `long_commute` | Binary flag — commute distance > 15 km |
| `no_stock_equity` | Binary flag — employee has zero stock option compensation |
| `career_stagnation` | No promotion in ≥3 years AND tenure ≥3 years — stagnation signal |

---

## 🤖 Models

Four classifiers were trained and evaluated with **5-fold stratified cross-validation**:

| Model | Strategy |
|-------|----------|
| **Logistic Regression** | L2-regularized, class-weighted — interpretable baseline |
| **Decision Tree** | Depth-limited, class-weighted — transparent rule-based model |
| **Random Forest** | 300 trees, balanced classes — robust ensemble benchmark |
| **XGBoost** | 300 rounds, scale_pos_weight=5 — state-of-the-art gradient boosting |

### Evaluation Metrics

Models are evaluated on **AUC-ROC, F1-Score, and Recall** (not raw accuracy) because:
- A naïve "always predict Stayed" model achieves 83.9% accuracy but catches **zero** at-risk employees
- **Recall** on the minority class (employees who leave) is the metric that matters most for HR intervention
- **AUC-ROC** provides threshold-independent comparison across models

## 🔬 SHAP Explainability

SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is applied to the XGBoost model to provide:

- **Bar summary** — global feature importance ranked by mean |SHAP value|
- **Beeswarm plot** — direction and magnitude of each feature's effect per employee
- Instance-level explanations: HR can understand *exactly why* any individual employee is flagged as high-risk

---

## 📈 Executive Dashboard

A single-page dashboard consolidates:
- 4 KPI cards (Attrition Rate, Headcount Left, Best AUC, OT Multiplier)
- Department attrition stacked bar
- Overtime donut chart
- ML risk tier distribution
- ROC curves for all four models
- Top 10 feature importances

## 💡 Business Recommendations

| Priority | Intervention | Evidence |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| 🔴 **1** | Enforce monthly overtime caps + OT compensation | 2.9× attrition multiplier |
| 🔴 **2** | Market salary benchmarking — especially Job Level 1 | 38% income gap |
| 🟡 **3** | Redesign Sales Representative career ladder | 39.8% role attrition |
| 🟡 **4** | Structured onboarding programme — 30/60/90 day milestones | 34–36% Year 0–1 attrition |
| 🟡 **5** | Expand stock option eligibility to all Level 1–2 employees | 2.6× equity multiplier |
| 🟢 **6** | Video-first travel policy — reduce frequent business travel | 24.9% vs 8.0% |
